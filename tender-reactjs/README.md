# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Key Decisions in Choosing ReactJS

### 1. Component Reusability
- Strong component-based architecture
- Easy to create and maintain reusable UI components for tender listings
- Efficient management of common elements like filters and tender cards

### 2. State Management
- Robust ecosystem with Redux/Context API for global state management
- Effective handling of complex tender visibility states
- Efficient management of user roles and permissions

### 3. Performance
- Virtual DOM for efficient UI updates
- Optimized rendering for large tender lists
- Fast client-side filtering and sorting capabilities

### 4. Development Efficiency
- Large ecosystem of ready-to-use components
- Extensive community support and resources
- Rich collection of development tools (React Developer Tools)
- Well-documented libraries for API integration (Axios)

### 5. Security
- XSS protection built into JSX
- Secure handling of user authentication
- Protected routes implementation

### 6. Community and Support
- Large active community
- Regular updates and improvements
- Extensive documentation and tutorials
- Wide range of third-party libraries

### 7. Integration Capabilities
- Seamless integration with REST APIs
- Easy implementation of real-time features
- Strong TypeScript support for type safety
